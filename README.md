# MandarinTone
Unlike in English, Mandarin is a tonal language. This means that not only does the word matter, but the tone in which the word is said. In Mandarin there
are four tones. For English speakers it is very difficult to get these tones correctly, since they do not exist in our language. It's very hard to practice
tones without a teacher. So I created a model which given an audio file, can with 97% accuracy detect what the tone of the word is. I used the PyTorch
library, and a prebuilt convolutional neural network. Currently, the model only works with tone, soon I will update it to also detect for word accuracy
as well.
